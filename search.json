    "text": "Researchers use p-values in the context of hypothesis testing to decide whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis. The routine goes as follows: before running the analysis/the hypothesis test, we decide on a significance level (or “alpha level”, typically 5% or 0.05) below which we decide to reject the null hypothesis. Next, we run the analysis/hypothesis test, and compute the p-value. If the p-value is below the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis: the p-value is “statistically significant”. If the p-value is above the significance level, we “fail to reject” the null hypothesis: the p-value is not statistically significant.\nThis is illustrated in this nifty pic. If we get a small p-value we are usually happy (no matter how close it is to 0.05), if we get a big p-value we cry (and wonder if our paper will ever get published). But what about p-values that are “hovering” just above 0.05?\n\nIn many published papers you will find such a “third kind” of p-value, which is commonly called the “marginally significant” p-value. Alternative names include p-values that are “trending towards significance”, “approaching significance”, “hovering just above the significance level”, or “almost significant”.\nSuch “marginally significant” p-values, however, simply do not exist. In other words, labeling some p-values as “marginally significant” is a statistical mistake (which is why I use this term between ” “). Let me tell you why."

    "section": "Reason 1: Mixing up frameworks for interpreting p-values",
    "text": "Reason 1: Mixing up frameworks for interpreting p-values\nHistorically, there were two mutually exclusive frameworks to interpret p-values: Fisher’s and Neyman’s & Pearson’s.\nFisher intended for p-values to be interpreted as a continuous measure of the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis. Under this framework, a p-value of 0.20 is viewed as weaker evidence against the null than a p-value of 0.02.\nNeyman & Pearson advocated to classify p-values as either significant or not significant, based on a pre-defined threshold ( \\alpha ). If p&lt; \\alpha, we reject the null hypothesis. If p &gt; \\alpha, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\nOur current way of interpreting p-values is a mix of the two: on the one hand, we apply a decision rule (like in the Neyman-Pearson framework), on the other hand, we use stars to indicate how small a p-value is: one star for p &lt; .05, two stars for 0.05 &lt; p &lt; .01, and two stars for p &lt; .001. Some R functions, like lm(), even use a dot ‘.’ for p-values between 0.1 and 0.05:\nsummary(lm(formula = y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = data))\n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    \n(Intercept)  2.95251    0.03297   89.55   &lt;2e-16 ***\nx1          -1.50722    0.01847  -81.58   &lt;2e-16 ***\nx2           0.81344    0.01808   44.99   &lt;2e-16 ***\nx3          -0.82236    0.03950  -20.82   &lt;2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1\nResearchers might be confused about the two paradigms and interpret p-values in a more Fisherian fashion, and not evaluate them vis-a-vis a decision threshold. Or rather: researchers do acknowledge that p-values should be below the chosen \\alpha-level in order to be interpreted as significant, but if the p-value is - in their subjective perception - “close enough” to 0.05, it is “practically” significant, by only a small margin. A.k.a., the p-value is “marginally significant”.\nUnfortunately, such an interpretation makes no sense. None of the three frameworks allow for the existence of “marginally significant” p-values. In Fisher’s framework, there is no hard boundary at which p-values automatically become “significant”. Per Fisher you would conclude that p=0.049 and p=0.051 constitute practically equivalent evidence against the null, but you would not call either “significant” per se. In Neyman-Pearson and our current way of interpreting p-values, we are interested in whether p&lt; \\alpha. There is no third kind of p-value that hovers just above our chosen \\alpha-level."

    "text": "Reason 2: Academic publish or perish environment and researchers’ disappointment\nStudies in academia take a lot of time to conduct and write up, and oftentimes even longer to get published. Imagine you are a researcher who has spent the last two years (and potentially thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of euros of tax payers’ money) on a study. You collected the data, ran the analysis, and the p-value of your hypothesis test is 0.06. The horror! How are you gonna get this published??? You know that journals are way more likely to publish papers that have significant p-values than papers reporting “null findings”! You were so sure that you were gonna get a significant p-value!\nWhat do you do?\nThe best option is, of course, to report the true outcome: the p-value is above the chosen \\alpha level, so based on the data that you have, there is insufficient evidence to reject the null. No biggie. Alternatively, you could resort to questionable or downright unethical research practices like p-hacking. Or you could label your result “marginally significant”, implying that “in the right light, if I had a somewhat bigger sample size, if the stars aligned, this would be significant, I swear!”\nTo be clear, the second option is terrible, don’t do it! The third option is somewhat better, but you should still not do it. For once, you are bending the rules: you shouldn’t willy-nilly change your \\alpha-level after running the analysis just because you don’t like the result (that’s not science). Second, you don’t actually know if you would get a “more significant” p-value if you had more data/if the sample size were bigger."
