    abstract = {Conflation of the terms and concepts of “sex” and “gender” continues to perpetuate the invisibility of sex and gender minorities and obscure information about the ways in which biological sex and gender affect health. The misuse of sex and gender terms and the sex and gender binaries can yield inaccurate results but also, more importantly, contributes to the erasure of intersex, transgender, nonbinary, and agender health experiences. In this article, we discuss ways in which public health researchers can use sex and gender terms correctly and center the health experiences of intersex, transgender, nonbinary, and agender individuals. This includes promoting sensitivity in approaching sex and gender minority communities, improving survey questions, and collaborating with GSM communities to improve research quality and participant experiences. Improving our standards for the quality of sex and gender term usage and centering sex and gender minorities in public health research are imperative to addressing the health inequalities faced by sex and gender minorities.},
