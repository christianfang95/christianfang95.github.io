::: {#hero-heading}
I am a statistical researcher in the demography team ofÂ [Statistics Netherlands (CBS)](http://cbs.nl/). Before joining Statistics Netherlands, I obtained a PhD at the Department of Sociology, Utrecht University. In my free time, I do CrossFit 4-5 times a week and care deeply about politics. Some of my favorite blogs are [Reality's Last Stand](https://www.realityslaststand.com), [Citation Needed](https://www.citationneededpodcast.com) and [Helen Joyce](https://www.thehelenjoyce.com).

On this website, you will find my publications, nerdy statistics blogs, and contact information.

Note that all opinions expressed on this website are strictly my own and are in no way supposed to reflect those of Statistics Netherlands.
